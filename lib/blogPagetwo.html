        <h2>Dummy blog two</h2>
        <strong>November,2022</strong>
        <p>On this blog’s My Story page, the creator explains how she couldn’t find an online space that featured anything other than people’s perfect marathon training journeys. In response, she created this wonderfully authentic blog highlighting her, “Running through life one struggle at a time.”
            <br/>
            The top fold features an image of the creator wearing crooked glasses and running on a treadmill with roller skates—a perfect embodiment of her blog title. Her site features individual pages for her blog, podcast and online store and includes links to her social media, all areas where she shares her incredibly relatable content.
