            <strong>As a teenager, what bothers you most about society today?</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Discrimination faced by the girl child bothers me the most. It is tough to digest if it starts with your father.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Let me tell you a story.</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Shital Hound was in her 20’s, born in a wealthy family, never found love from her parent.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            Her father, Sam Hound, barely talked to her because he believed that the only son could hold his huge empire and girls are useless.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After she was born, her mother died at the hospital.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She became the president of Hound & sons after the early death of his father.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Hound& son were in debt and bankers refuse to give loan to the company because the president of the company was a lady.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Bankers believed that the company couldn’t run by a woman and it would be a waste of their money. But they were agreed to give load if the president would be a man.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Shital had faced discrimination not only by society but by her family too.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Shital had always regretted that why she came into this world. Even she didn't do anything wrong, just because she was a girl child, everyone was punishing her.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The girls should be treated the same as you treat your son.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Father has the family's reins. So, it totally depends upon father that which type of society the father wants.
            <br/>

            This story is just an example. I have seen in my circumstances that how people differentiate on the basis of gender. They always give importance to the boy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Treat equally. This would lead to a better society.
            <br/>
            Don't discriminate.
