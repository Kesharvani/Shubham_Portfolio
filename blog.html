        <h2>Non Technical Blog One</h2>
        <strong>November,2022</strong>
        <p>
            <strong>As a teenager, what bothers you most about society today?</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Discrimination faced by the girl child bothers me the most. It is tough to digest if it starts with your father.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Let me tell you a story.</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Shital Hound was in her 20’s, born in a wealthy family, never found love from her parent.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            Her father, Sam Hound, barely talked to her because he believed that the only son could hold his huge empire and girls are useless.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After she was born, her mother died at the hospital.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She became the president of Hound & sons after the early death of his father.

        <h2>Dummy blog two</h2>
        <strong>November,2022</strong>
        <p>On this blog’s My Story page, the creator explains how she couldn’t find an online space that featured anything other than people’s perfect marathon training journeys. In response, she created this wonderfully authentic blog highlighting her, “Running through life one struggle at a time.”
